## Dummy app that's running marketmaker2

[AtomicDEX](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/) is open source software
for running decentralised atomic cryptocurrency swaps.

This repository shows me experimenting with running the mm2 library on Android, in an Android app.

The main functionality can be found in `MainActivity.java` and `MyService.java`.
Shout me a message on [Komodo's Discord](https://www.komodoplatform.com/discord) if you have any questions (username: `bartwr`).
